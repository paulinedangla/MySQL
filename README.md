# EXPLORE THE WORLD OF SQL LANGUAGE

This workbook concentrates all the lessons and exercises that I followed during my learning of the SQL language :

- [HackerRank exercises on SQL](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql).
- The various research I conducted to consolidate my knowledge.

# TELL US ABOUT YOURSELF

## Who are you ?

My name is [Pauline DANGLA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pauline-dangla-a8907314b/) and I am currently a senior financial auditor in the Social and Solidarity Economy sector and in the Public sector in a large international firm.
In short, my job consists of verifying the accounting, financial and legal principles of each accounting closing in order to ensure that the accounts are regular, faithful and sincere.
I handle large databases daily on Excel and on our internal analysis tools.

## Why did you do this project ?

I chose to learn the SQL programming language because I am currently in professional retraining in the data sector.
My goal is to learn SQL then Python languages and then familiarize myself with Tableau.

## When did you work on this project ?

I have been working on this project since the beginning of June 2022. This learning is separated into three times :
- June 2022 : UDEMY online course.
- First half of July 2022 : exercises on HackerRank.
- From the second half of July 2022 and until obtaining a job in the data sector : continuous research and projects.

This work is therefore still in progress and is regularly updated.

## What did you take away from this learning ?

- SQL structured queries provide concrete solutions to complex issues.
- SQL is a complete language because it allows databases to use a universal language to transmit information.

## What are the new paths to explore now ?

- The relationship between the SQL language and other languages.
- Streamline my queries through several databases (virtual or not).
