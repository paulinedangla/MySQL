## 1 - COUNT

SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS books_number
FROM books;

SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT author_lname) AS author_last_name_count 
FROM books;

SELECT 
  COUNT(title) AS numbers_of_the 
FROM books WHERE title LIKE '%the%';

## 2 - GROUP BY

SELECT title, author_lname FROM books GROUP BY author_lname;

SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS numbers_books_by_author, 
  author_lname 
FROM books GROUP BY author_lname;

SELECT 
  author_lname, 
  author_fname, 
  COUNT(*) AS numbers_books_by_author
FROM books GROUP BY author_fname, author_lname;

SELECT
  CONCAT(
    'In ', 
    released_year,
    ', ', 
    COUNT(*), 
    ' book(s) released') AS numbers_released_by_year 
FROM books GROUP BY released_year;
  
## 3 - MIN and MAX

SELECT MIN(released_year) FROM books;

-- What is the longest book ? I can choose two requests to answer for this question --

-- The first answer with a sub request - 

SELECT title, pages FROM books WHERE pages =(SELECT MAX(pages) FROM books);

-- Or, a shorter answer without MAX --

SELECT title, pages FROM books ORDER BY pages DESC LIMIT 1;

## 4 - MIN and MAX with GROUP BY

SELECT
  author_lname,
  author_fname,
  MIN(released_year)
FROM books
GROUP BY author_lname, author_fname;

SELECT
  CONCAT(author_lname, ' ', author_fname) AS author,
  MAX(pages) AS longest_book
FROM books
GROUP BY author_lname, author_fname;

## 5 - SUM
 
 SELECT SUM(pages) FROM books;
 
 SELECT 
  author_lname,

  SUM(pages) 
FROM books GROUP BY author_lname, author_fname;

## 6 - AVG
